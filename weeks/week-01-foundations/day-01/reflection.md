# Daily Reflection

### What surprised me today:
I thought bash understands each command and interacts directly with the OS, but to find out that it only reads it, parses and send the info to the kernel to handle the rest.

### What i thought Bash was (Before):
I thought Bash was inside the os and interacting directly with kernel

### What Bash actually is:
Bash is a scripting language, what it does is read text, parse it and hands it to the kernel to do the operations. Thats the simplest i can explain this.
